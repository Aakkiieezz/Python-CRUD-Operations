Technicalities :

app.run(port=5000) 				    # start the flask application, starts on port 5000 on local comp
@app.route('/endpoint') 		    # used to map the specific URL with the associated function
cursor = connection.cursor() 	    # for executing a query, then store its results
connection.commit()				    # this will actually save the changes made to the database
jsonify()			 				# converts into JSON
json.loads()						# converts into dictionary
request.form[]					    # supplies data from frontend to backend
response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*') # some safety measurement
$.get()							    # backend/HTTP call, after calling $.get() we get response/callback which contains all the required data
$.ajax()							# backend/HTTP POST call
window.location.reload()		    # refreshing the window

# HTTP input methods -> GET , POST (called REST api / RESTful api)
# GET is used to request data from a specified resource.
# POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

To fix :

While making an order, user has option to buy the same product again.
Therefore the order is getting placed as it has unique order id, but the order details for that order is not saved as there is duplicate product id.
-> User should not have the option to select the same product again from the dropdown menu while making an order.

When product is edited, the orderDetails regarding that product is not changing
-> foreign key on update value has to be changed, but unable to

When product is deleted, the orderDetails regarding that product is getting deleted
-> foreign key on delete value has to be changed, but unable to
